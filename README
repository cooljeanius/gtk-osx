This repository is used to maintain the configurations and modulesets
for building GTK+ OS X with jhbuild.

NOTE: If you only want to build GTK+, just download
gtk-osx-build-setup.sh and follow the instructions at:

http://web.archive.org/web/20150510035657/https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GTK+/OSX/Building?action=show&redirect=GTK%2B%2FOSX%2FBuilding

There are 3 modulesets. You can select the one which most suits you by
adding the line
      moduleset="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk-osx/plain/modulesets-stable/gtk-osx.modules"

to your ~/.jhbuildrc-custom, replacing "modulesets-stable" (the default) with 

 * modulesets-stable: The default, all tarball-based released sources.
 * modulesets: Sources from VCS repositories when that's available,
   with stable release revisions set for each module.
 * modulesets-unstable: The bleeding edge modulesets, pulled from VCS
   repositories with no release revisions.
